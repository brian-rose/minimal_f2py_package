# minimalf2py

![Build and test](https://github.com/brian-rose/minimalf2py/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yaml/badge.svg)

A minimal package to diagnose issues with building Python / Fortran packages with f2py

Also a useful working example of how to use GitHub Actions to build this kind of package for Linux, MacOs, and Windows.
