# minimalf2py

[![Build and test](https://github.com/brian-rose/minimalf2py/workflows/build-and-test.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/brian-rose/minimalf2py/actions/)

A minimal package to diagnose issues with building Python / Fortran packages with f2py

Also a useful working example of how to use GitHub Actions to build this kind of package for Linux, MacOs, and Windows.
